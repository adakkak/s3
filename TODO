v 0.1 release:
  make sure copyright/contributers info is correct
  exception/feedback tool
  help/about section
  logo?
  "accounts"
    setting priviledges on a bucket
    button styling
  
  "keys"
    upload button
    links to torrent/http
    linkify location info (so you can go up directories)
    date format sucks

future:
  setting priviledges on a key
  uploading should have a progress meter
  file size should show in page info
  do xslt/key list in channel instead of on page so it is cached
  support the logging of buckets feature
  right click handlers for creating url/torrent/...
  create time limited url for key
  support adding people to buckets via email addresses
  when S3Ajax.upload fails add a dialog to ask what mime type the user wants to use?

bugs:
  s3://twitter_production/profile_background_images/1001042/ -- cannot click the contained thing
  s3://twitter_production/profile_background_images/ -- css breaks (the background stops) about 2/3 down
  s3://what/ -- acts weird
  setup credentials only works once due to blockUI
